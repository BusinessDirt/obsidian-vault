Use yaml to structure the cards and then use a plugin to generate html elements with custom css classes.

Example:
```infocards
{
	"Strukturformel": {
		"img": "insert link here"
	},
	"Allgemeines": {
		"Name": "Isocyans채ure",
		"Summenformel": "HNCO",
		"Kurzbeschreibung": "oberhalb von 0째C wenig best채ndige Fl체ssigkeit, die zur Polymerisation neigt."
	},
	"Externe Identifikatoren / Datenbanken": {
		"CAS-Nummer": "75-13-8"
	},
	"Eigenschaften"
}
```

## Basic Features
- Headers will have an Object as type and the depth determines the heading level
- Paragraphs will have a String as type
- Images might also have a String as its type but will be detected by the String being a link

## Maybe Features
- Per Card css (would probably require each element to be an Object and therefore clutter up the file; could be an optional setting)
